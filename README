Version: 0.4

Summary
Alfresco Max Version Policy limits the number of versions that are created for a
versioned node. The default value is set for 10 versions per node.  This can be 
overridden by copying the maxversionpolicy-context.xml file into the extensions directory
and changing the value of the maxVersion property.

Install
Alfresco Max Version Policy is delivered as an AMP.  Copy the AMP into the amps 
directory and run the apply_amps.[sh|bat] script. Alfresco must not be running when you 
apply the AMP.

Currently  tested against 3.2.x && 3.3.x
