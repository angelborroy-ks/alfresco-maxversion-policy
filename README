Version: 0.0.5

Summary
Alfresco Max Version Policy limits the number of versions that are created for a
versioned node. The default value is set for 10 versions per node.  This can be 
overridden by setting maxVersions=<value> in alfresco-global.properties file.

Install
Alfresco Max Version Policy is delivered as an AMP ([https://github.com/jottley/alfresco-maxversion-policy/blob/master/max-version-policy-0.0.5.amp]).  Copy the AMP into the amps 
directory and run the apply_amps.[sh|bat] script. Alfresco must not be running when you 
apply the AMP.
